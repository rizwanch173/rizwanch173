## Currently working on following App

Role: Flutter Mobile App developer & Django developer.

Currently I'm developing an investment app that allows users to create investment accounts and choose from a variety of funds, each with a specific risk profile—ranging from high to low risk. 

The onboarding process involves a series of Q&A steps designed to assess the user's risk tolerance. Based on the answers provided, the app generates a personalized risk profile and recommends suitable funds. Users can then select funds to attach to their investment accounts.

Following this, users are prompted to complete a KYC (Know Your Customer) process, finalizing their investment profile. Additionally, users can add bank accounts to facilitate deposits and withdrawals directly within the app.
